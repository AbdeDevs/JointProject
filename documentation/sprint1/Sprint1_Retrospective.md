| Action                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database planning                          | Populate database once the models are done and revise the models to avoid inconsistencies and future problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Database removal                           | Ensure that all commands related to migrations are working before merging the changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Communication between frontend and backend | Ensure that all changes from backend must be communicated to the fronted. Moreover, backend must follow the structure defined on the prototypes. This changes may be comunicated in the text channels and in the dailies. A new channel on discord will be created to communicate all the changes decisions made during the sprint. |
| Time organization                          | Improve the issues so are more centered on prototypes and roles. We will let 3 days before the sprint ends to review the sprint and test all the bugs.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Project structure                          | Define the project structure before starting the sprint. The urls must follow the prototype and the database model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Task dependencies                          | Indentify the tasks dependencies in the sprint planning and assign the issues according those. Add this information in the issues description.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Testing the project                        | Ensure that when the feature implemented the tests related are done and are working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Improve dailies                            | Request dailies if are needed. At least there are needed 2 dailies every week. Add constant feedback of work done in the dailies.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
