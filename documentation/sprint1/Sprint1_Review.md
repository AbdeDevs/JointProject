| Refactor delete reservation button | Reservations must not be completely deleted from the system, they have to remain in the reservation database (log) but hidden from the receptionist worker. |
| Poblate database                   | Project database must be filled with multiple entries to show the client a more realistic view and to test it properly.                                     |
