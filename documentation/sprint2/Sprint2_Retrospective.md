## Retrospective Overview

| Team Member      | Issue Found                                                                                                                                |

| Aniol & Sergi    | We had problems on marking a rom as is_cleaned. This field is duplicated and needs to be reproached.                                       |
| Aniol            | For the restaurant reservations the reservations need to be filtered and have the ability to mark a reservation as the client has arrived. |
| Abdellah & Aniol | The bills need to be improved since it its too basic and dont provide the enough information.                                              |
