| P1      | Receipts                                        | Aniol | Some of the receipts of the receptionist weren't working as expected. In check-in bill the prices weren't showing.                                                                                                                        |
| P2      | Check-in print process                          | Aniol | The process of printing the bill of the check-in has been adjusted to match the check-out one and the prototypes. Then, since the urls were affected two unit tests were failing, that tests had to be changed with the new url redirect. |
| P3      | Guests reservation screen                       | Sergi | The guests reservation screen was not following as the prototypes and it needs a rework.                                                                                                                                                  |
| P4      | Planner assigns rooms to clean frontend problem | Júlia | The interface of the planner assigns rooms to clean detail it is more difficult than expected.                                                                                                                                            |
