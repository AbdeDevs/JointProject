| P1      | Receipts               | Aniol | Some of the receipts of the receptionist weren't working as expected. In check-in bill the prices weren't showing.                                                                                                                        |
| P2      | Check-in print process | Aniol | The process of printing the bill of the check-in has been adjusted to match the check-out one and the prototypes. Then, since the urls were affected two unit tests were failing, that tests had to be changed with the new url redirect. |
